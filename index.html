                    <p>My name is Kela, I'm the one on the right in the picture above. I've been working in kitchens and recently as a sous chef for the last 5 years.
                        I want to learn new skills in programming because not only do I want to possibly follow that career path, I just genuinely love learning and feeling my brain suddenly "click"...so to speak, <span class="em">especially</span> if it's challenging!</p>
