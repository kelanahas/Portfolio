                <p>My name is Kela, I'm the one on the right in the picture above. I've been working in kitchens and recently as a sous chef for the last 5 years.
                I want to learn new skills in programming because not only do I want to possibly follow a career in it, I just genuinely love learning and feeling my brain "click" so to speak...<span class="em">especially</span> if what I am learning is a challenge.
                </p>
